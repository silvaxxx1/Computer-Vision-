# Computer Vision with PyTorch

This repository is a collection of deep learning-based computer vision systems, built from the ground up, starting with simple neural networks in NumPy and scaling up to more advanced deep learning architectures. The projects range from basic image classification to more complex systems like object detection, tracking, segmentation, and cutting-edge transformer-based vision systems.

The goal is to cover **end-to-end deep learning workflows for computer vision**, including data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and deployment. The repository also explores multimodal systems, such as image captioning, and aims to implement state-of-the-art models for 3D vision and beyond.

## Features

- **Basic Neural Networks**: Implementation of simple Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) from scratch, using only NumPy for learning the fundamentals.
- **Image Classification**: Building deep learning models for classifying images into various categories.
- **Object Detection and Tracking**: Implementing systems that not only detect objects but also track them across frames.
- **Image Segmentation**: Models that segment images into meaningful regions.
- **Transformer-based Vision Models**: Advanced vision systems using transformer architectures for tasks such as detection and segmentation.
- **Image Captioning**: End-to-end systems that generate captions for images.
- **Multimodal Learning**: Combining vision with other modalities to enhance performance, such as vision and language for tasks like image captioning.
